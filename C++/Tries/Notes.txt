Trie Practice in C++

Background information about a trie:
  Tries are data structures which support insertions of k length word in O(k) time.
  Supports searching of a k length word in O(k) time.
  Many other custom functions like number of words with a given prefix, can be implemented.

In the example trie in this folder, the following is implemented:
  void insert (string word)
    This inserst the given word into the Trie
  bool search (string word)
    search for a given word in the trie and return true or false
  int words_with_prefix (string prefix)
    find a count of words in the trie which has the given word as prefix_count

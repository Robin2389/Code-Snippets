SAP uses HANA

HANA has three main process
  DP - Data Provisioning
  DM - Data Modeling
  DR - Data Reporting

There are two types of systems:
  OLTP - Online Transaction Processing
  OLAP - Online Analytics systems

OLTP: SAP Ultra Business system is an OLTP system
    We create transactions we right systems.

OLAP: This is reading data to perform analytics.



Let's look at the databases:
  SAP ERP database
    Written in MSSQL or something like this

This gets put into a HANA systems
  In order to get transfered into a HANA system, the data must be provisioned
    STP is an example DP Software
